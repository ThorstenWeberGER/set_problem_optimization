# Containts bugs to solve

- locations stats between results on map and exported CSV are consistent, BUT: sum of total customers AND total weighted customers 
    - does not match to legend sums
    - does not sum up to 90k total and 81k goal
- map plz 
    - plz5 cells show very low customers per plz
    - sum plz5 cells for a location "seems" not to come to total shown in popup of location
- customers.csv
    - redundancy?
